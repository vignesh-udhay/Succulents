    			<div class="answer a">
    				<p id="p1">Succulents are a group of plants that store water in their leaves. The leaves tend to be thick and fleshy due to the development of water storing tissue, but some genus and species have thicker leaves than others. Succulents tend to thrive in dry climates and don’t like a lot of humidity.</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="answer b">
    				<p id="p2">As with any other plant, proper watering will ensure the best growth and flowering. While they do need water to survive, they can endure extended periods of drought, relying on the stored water and nutrients in their leaves. If their roots are sitting in water for too long they will start to rot and die.</p>

						<h1 id="rule1">Southern Light</h1>
						<p>Succulents prefer bright light, such as found on a south-facing window. Watch the leaves for indications that the light level is correct. Some species will scorch if suddenly exposed to direct sunlight. Alternatively, an underlit succulent will begin to stretch, with an elongated stem and widely spaced leaves. This condition is known as 'etoliation'. The solution is to provide better light and prune the plant back to its original shape.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box">
						<h1 id="rule2">Watering</h1>
						<p>Succulents should be watered generously in the summer. The potting mix should be allowed to dry between waterings, but do not underwater. During the winter, when the plants go dormant, cut watering back to once every other month. Overwatering and ensuing plant rot is the single most common cause of plant failure. Be aware, though, that an overwatered succulent might at first plump up and look very healthy.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box">
						<h1 id="rule3">Temperature</h1>
						<p>Succulents are much more cold-tolerant than many people assume. As in the desert, where there is often a marked contrast between night and day, succulents thrive in colder nights, down to even 40ºF. Ideally, succulents prefer daytime temperatures between 70 F and about 85 F and nighttime temperatures between 50 F and 55 F.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box">
						<h1 id="rule4">Potting Soil</h1>
						<p>Succulents should be potted in a fast-draining mixture that's designed for cacti and succulents. If you don't have access to a specialized mix, consider modifying a normal potting mix with an inorganic agent like perlite to increase aeration and drainage. These plants have shallow roots that form a dense mat just under the soil surface.</p>
