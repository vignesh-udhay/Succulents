          <h1>Echeveria</h1>
          <p>Plants may be evergreen or deciduous. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves. Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes. Many species of Echeveria serve important environmental roles, such as those of host plants for butterflies.</p>

          <h1>Crasulla</h1>
          <p>Crassula is a diverse and extensive genus of succulent plants, with about 350 species. Probably the most well-known is Jade plant (Crassula ovata). In warm climates, it grows into a shrub. Many other Crassula species are much smaller, including some miniatures and creeping ground covers</p>

          <h1>Graptopetalum</h1>
          <p>Graptopetalum is a small genus of the family Crassulaceae. They are perennial succulent plants and native to Mexico and Arizona. Their leaves vary in colour from silver-grey to pink to waxy green, and are often speckled. They all have thick leaves forming rosettes with star-shaped flowers from white to pink on long stems. All require lots of sun to look their best</p>

          <h1>Haworthia</h1>
          <p>Haworthias are small succulent plants, forming rosettes of leaves from 3 cm to exceptionally 30 cm in diameter, depending on the species. These rosettes are usually stemless but in some species stems reach up to 50 cm. The inflorescences of some species may exceed 40 cm in height. The plants can grow solitary or can be clump-forming.</p>

          <h1>Kalanchoe</h1>
          <p>Most are shrubs or perennial herbaceous plants, but a few are annual or biennial. The largest, Kalanchoe beharensis from Madagascar, can reach 6 m tall, but most species are less than 1 m tall. Kalanchoes are characterized by opening their flowers by growing new cells on the inner surface of the petals to force them outwards, and on the outside of the petals to close them. Kalanchoe flowers are divided into 4 sections with 8 stamens.</p>

          <h1>Graptoveria</h1>
          <p>Graptoveria are succulent plants that are hybrid crosses between Graptopetalum and Echeveria. Graptoveria is an attractive and durable succulent plant that produces clusters of tight rosettes up to 6 inches (15 cm) wide and up to 8 inches (20 cm) tall, with thick, smooth, upright-held, pale blue-green leaves that have a hint of pink tones on the leaf tips and margins when grown in bright light.</p>

          <h1>Lithops</h1>
          <p>Living Stones (Lithops) are unusual succulents that have evolved to resemble the pebbles and rocks that litter their native habitats through southern Africa. These very small plants hug the ground and grow extremely slowly. It can take years for a plant to eventually fill its pots with new leaves. Structurally, Lithops are comprised of two fused leaves above ground that connect to an underground stem with a long root.</p>

          <h1>Fenestraria</h1>
          <p>The genus Fenestraria (Baby Toes or Window Plant) is found in the winter rainfall region of southeastern Namibia and South Africa. The dwarf plants form mats or small clumps in sandy soil. The leaves are flat-topped and windowed, with generally only the uppermost portion exposed in the wild. They possess thick, fleshy roots.</p>

          <h1>Euphorbia</h1>
          <p>This genus is extremely varied in its plant forms and habitats, ranging from large, succulent trees and tiny, compact succulents to herbaceous perennials and semi- or evergreen, herbaceous shrubs. Their unique flower structure consists of conspicuous leaf bracts of yellow, red, purple, brown, or green, with tiny, male and female floral parts in contrasting colors. Many species are notable for these peculiar flowers, as well as their handsome foliage and their remarkable form.</p>
